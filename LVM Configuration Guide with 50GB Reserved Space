LVM Configuration Guide with 50GB Reserved Space
This guide explains how to configure a 100GB disk for LVM, allocating 50GB to a Logical Volume (LV) while keeping the remaining 50GB unused in the Volume Group (VG) for future expansion.
1. Check Available Disks
To list all available disks, use one of the following commands:
lsblk
fdisk -l
2. Create a Physical Volume (PV)
Once you have identified the disk (e.g., /dev/sdb), initialize it as a PV:
pvcreate /dev/sdb
3. Create a Volume Group (VG)
Create a Volume Group named APPVG:
vgcreate APPVG /dev/sdb
4. Verify the Volume Group
To check allocated and free space in the VG:
vgdisplay APPVG
5. Create a Logical Volume with 50GB
Allocate 50GB to a Logical Volume (LV) named APP_LV:
lvcreate -L 50G -n APP_LV APPVG
6. Format the Logical Volume
Format the LV with ext4 filesystem:
mkfs.ext4 /dev/APPVG/APP_LV
7. Mount the Logical Volume
Create a mount directory and mount the LV:
mkdir /mnt/app
mount /dev/APPVG/APP_LV /mnt/app
8. Add to /etc/fstab for Persistent Mounting
To ensure the LV mounts automatically after reboot, add the following line to /etc/fstab:
echo "/dev/APPVG/APP_LV /mnt/app ext4 defaults 0 2" >> /etc/fstab
9. Verify Mounting with mount -a
After updating /etc/fstab, run the following command to verify that all defined mounts are applied:
mount -a
10. Check Remaining Free Space in VG
To view used and remaining space in the VG:
vgdisplay APPVG
vgs
11. Expand LV in the Future
If you want to add the remaining 50GB to APP_LV in the future:
lvextend -L +50G /dev/APPVG/APP_LV
Then, resize the filesystem accordingly:
For ext4:
resize2fs /dev/APPVG/APP_LV
For XFS:
xfs_growfs /mnt/app
